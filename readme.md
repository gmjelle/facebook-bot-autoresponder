Repo for all the code talked about in this blogpost: (todo).

This code monitors all the comments of a Facebook post, and then comments on the comments with a custom photo.
In this code there is an example on how you can make it respond with an image that includes the orginal commenter's profile picture.

This code is just a demo :) Especially with HTTP requests there should be some error handling. But that shouldn't be too hard to implement!
## Requirements

- Python 3 and all the requirements in the requirements.txt file
- A (published) Facebook page
- A Facebook app
- An access token (In the blogpost you'll learn how to get a long-lived access token)

## Accompanying blogpost

Need more info? I created a whole blogpost to explain the code and how you can change it to suit your needs.

## Thanks
Special thanks to Inti De Ceukelaire, who was the first one to write (I think) to write such a tool. 
You can find more info about how he implemented it [here (in Dutch)](https://medium.com/cookiesclub/de-robotrevolte-studio-brussel-nam-de-eerste-facebookbot-in-dienst-81de19d6ed6d).
